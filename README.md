# BrewWitch

BrewWitch is an **UNFINISHED** game written for love2d in Lua. It was originally going to be my entry 
for [GBJAM 5](itch.io/jam/gbjam-5) but I wasn't able to finish it on time... so I decided to 
post it so maybe something useful can come of it!

Currently, you can press the arrow keys, and 'X' to open the Brew Menu. Z / X and Arrows to manipulate the menu.
The menu alternates between 'success' and 'failed' for animation states and that's it. Pressing up in front of the
stairs will climb the stairs, ladder too!

I'm hoping maybe someone will get some use out of it as an example program / demo, or just a 'use case' to study.
There's the capability for it to extend to multiple 'screens.' I disabled it while working on it for the jam, should
bue trivial to turn it back on.
